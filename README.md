**Medical Classification Project** - Predicting heart disease risk using machine learning classification algorithms.

## 📊 Overview

This project applies supervised learning techniques to classify patients with/without heart disease based on clinical features. Demonstrates end-to-end ML pipeline including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and comparison.

**Objectives:**
- ✅ Build accurate disease prediction model
- ✅ Compare multiple classification algorithms
- ✅ Evaluate model performance with medical metrics
- ✅ Create interpretable results for healthcare professionals
- ✅ Demonstrate data science best practices

## 🛠️ Technologies

```
Python | Pandas | NumPy | Scikit-learn | Matplotlib | Jupyter
```

## 🔍 Algorithms Implemented

**Logistic Regression:** Linear baseline model  
**Random Forest:** Ensemble method, feature importance  
**SVM:** Support Vector Machine for classification  
**Neural Network:** Deep learning approach  

## 📈 Dataset Features

- Age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol
- Chest pain type, maximum heart rate
- ST depression, exercise-induced angina
- Target: Heart disease present (0/1)

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
